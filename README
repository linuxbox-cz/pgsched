PG scheduler alias pgsched is a minimal python daemon providing cron/at/init
functionality at a PostgreSQL server.

HOW IT WORKS
	* pgsched daemon connects to PostgreSQL server and looks for all databases
	  containing pgsched schema.
	* pgsched schema contains (among other thing) 3 tables:
          - pgs_cron:   periodic tasks with cron scheduling
		  - pgs_at:     one-time tasks ran at specific time
		  - pgs_runner: continuous tasks
      By INSERTing into these tables, tasks are scheduled and later run by
	  pgsched.

REQUIREMENTS
	server-side:
		* PostgreSQL (tested on 9.0, should work on 8.4)
		* hstore module from postgresql-contrib
	deamon-side:
		* python >= 2.4
		* lbasync
		* psycopg2

INSTALL
	RPM package: /home/lbox/rpms/lbox-pgsched/

	Install hstore from postgresql-contrib into public schema of all databases
	you wish to use pgsched in:
	/usr/pgsql-9.0/share/contrib/hstore.sql

	Create PostgreSQL pgsched superuser and install pgsched schema into
	all databases you wish to use pgsched in:
	/usr/pgsql-9.0/share/lbox/pgsched.sql (edit to your needs)

USAGE
	lbasync and pgasync are used, daemon can be controlled by environmental variables:
		PGHOST, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD
		LOG_FILE
	When using pgsched service from RPM, export set these in /etc/sysconfig/pgsched, i.e.:
		export PGHOST=hostname                                                                                        
		export PGUSER=pgsched                                                                                        
		export PGPASSWORD=secret
	
	INSERT into pgs_{cron,at,runner} tables to schedule tasks.

	Interesting columns are COMMENTed, use `\d+ pgs_{cron,at,runner}` in psql
	to get some info.

LOGGING
	Task event logging is controled by per-task log_level column. Possible values are:
		0 - never log
		1 - log errors [default]
		2 - log errors & task run/finish
	Logs are saved in pgsched.pgs_log table.

	Daemon also logs into file using lbasync - LOG_FILE env. variable is used,
	defaults to /var/log/lbox/pgsched.log
